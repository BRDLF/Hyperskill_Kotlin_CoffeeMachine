# Hyperskill_Kotlin_CoffeeMachine

This was the first project I completed as part of Jetbrain Academy's "Kotlin Basics" course

It is rated as an easy project. It asks the student to write code that simulates a coffee machine.
It lays the groundwork for understanding basic Kotlin syntax for variables, classes, enums. As well as basic coding principles such as control flow and handling state.

I'd already used Java 11 before this so it wasn't terribly challenging. But now that I'm more familiar with Kotlin, I might go back and change a few things.

I've decided to also include the tests Hyperskill uses in order to verify a complete project.
